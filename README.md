# Configmap Manifest 


The ConfigMap in the example you provided is important for storing configuration data that can be consumed by applications running in your Kubernetes cluster.

It allows you to decouple the configuration from your application code and make it configurable at runtime.

In the given ConfigMap, you have two key-value pairs defined under the data section:

app.properties: This key represents a configuration file for an application. 

It contains two properties, key1 and key2, with their respective values. This configuration file can be mounted as a volume or passed as environment variables to the application pods.

database.properties: This key represents another configuration file specific to a database. 

It contains properties like db.host, db.port, db.username, and db.password. 

These values can be used by your application to connect to the specified database.

By using ConfigMaps, you can manage and update the configuration data separately from your application code. 

This allows you to make configuration changes without rebuilding or redeploying your application, making it more flexible and easier to manage in a Kubernetes environment.

Applications can access the configuration data stored in the ConfigMap either through environment variables injected into the container or by mounting the ConfigMap as a volume and reading the configuration files directly.

Overall, ConfigMaps provide a way to centralize and manage application configuration data in a Kubernetes cluster, enabling better separation of concerns and easier maintenance of your applications.

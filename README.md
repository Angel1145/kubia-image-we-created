# Types of deployments in Kubernetes 

Stateful Deployment:

A stateful deployment is suitable when your application requires persistent data or maintains some form of state that needs to be preserved. 

Imagine an online shopping application where users have shopping carts. 

In a stateful deployment, each user's shopping cart data would be stored and associated with a specific application instance. 

This ensures that even if the application or the underlying infrastructure fails, the user's shopping cart data remains intact.

Stateless Deployment:

A stateless deployment, on the other hand, is appropriate when your application doesn't rely on persistent data or maintain any long-term state. 

It treats each request independently, without relying on previous requests or storing data internally. An example could be a weather forecasting service that provides current weather information. 

Each request for weather data is independent of previous requests, and you don't need to maintain any state between requests.

Stateful deployments are useful when your application requires persistent data or maintains state, such as user sessions, databases, or queues.

Stateless deployments are suitable when your application doesn't rely on persistent data or maintain state and treats each request independently.

# Configmap Manifest 


The ConfigMap in the example you provided is important for storing configuration data that can be consumed by applications running in your Kubernetes cluster.

It allows you to decouple the configuration from your application code and make it configurable at runtime.

In the given ConfigMap, you have two key-value pairs defined under the data section:

app.properties: This key represents a configuration file for an application. 

It contains two properties, key1 and key2, with their respective values. This configuration file can be mounted as a volume or passed as environment variables to the application pods.

database.properties: This key represents another configuration file specific to a database. 

It contains properties like db.host, db.port, db.username, and db.password. 

These values can be used by your application to connect to the specified database.

By using ConfigMaps, you can manage and update the configuration data separately from your application code. 

This allows you to make configuration changes without rebuilding or redeploying your application, making it more flexible and easier to manage in a Kubernetes environment.

Applications can access the configuration data stored in the ConfigMap either through environment variables injected into the container or by mounting the ConfigMap as a volume and reading the configuration files directly.

Overall, ConfigMaps provide a way to centralize and manage application configuration data in a Kubernetes cluster, enabling better separation of concerns and easier maintenance of your applications.
